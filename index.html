    <h3>What is Dolar Red?</h3>
    <p id="red">"Dolar Red" is a calculated value meant to represent a Canadianized version of the Dolar Blue. Instead of the unofficial (or "free") exchange rate between USD and ARS, it's an unofficial exchange rate between CAD and ARS. It's a simple calculation as follows:</p>
    <p id="white">Dolar Red = Dolar MEP / USD-CAD exchange rate</p>
